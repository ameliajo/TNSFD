.. Since a prerequisite for coherent elastic scattering is spatial correlation of atomic sites, this type of scattering is not considered for amorphous solids or liquids, only regular repeating strucures (e.g. FCC, BCC, HCP, etc.). 

.. If a material is comprised of strong coherent scatterers (e.g. graphite) where there is strong spatial correlation between atomic sites (such as in a crystalline material), the scattered neutron waves from zero-phonon collisions can interfere, creating **coherent elastic scattering**. This scattering phenonema leads to "Bragg diffraction". 








.. The differential coherent elastic scattering cross section is given by 

.. .. math:: 
  \sigma_{coh.el}(E,\mu)=\frac{\sigma_c}{E}\sum_{E_i<E}f_i~\mathrm{e}^{-4WE_i}~\delta(\mu-\mu_i)

.. where 

.. .. math::
  \mu_i=1-\frac{E_i}{E}.

.. Furthermore, the integrated cross section is given by 

.. .. math:: 
  \sigma_{coh.el}(E)=\frac{\sigma_{coh}}{E}\sum_{E_i<E}f_i~\mathrm{e}^{-4WE_i}.

.. Here, :math:`\sigma_{coh}` is the effective bound scattering cross section for the material, :math:`E_i` are the "Bragg Edges", :math:`f_i` are related to the crystallographic structure factors, and
